on or before 20 OCT 2020 ALL 5 EXPERIMENTS

awgn(x,0)//inbuild cmd to add additivie white noise
0 is SNR S/N=1
x=real 
n=sqrt(control power)randn(1,length(x)) (original but use awgn(x,0))
n=sqrt(control power)randn(1,length(x)) + jrandn(i,L)) (for imaginary random nos)

received signal
ho(t) = Po(Tb-t)      positive pulse
h1(t) = P1(Tb-t)      negative pulse

y=x+noise
y0=y over 0 to Tb
y1=y over Tb to 2Tb
y2=y over 2Tb to 3Tb

ro = yo * h0
r1 = y0 * h1


bn and rn
reconstructed signal contain error or not by bitwise XOR(bn,rn)
